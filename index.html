    <h1>All About Coffee</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="top-p"><strong>Coffee is brewed from the roasted beans of a shrub native to the subtropical regions of Africa and Asia known simply as the coffee plant.
      Once the plant is harvested, only the seed is extracted. The size, shape and flavor vary depending on the conditions in which they were grown.
    </strong></p> <br>
    <h3>Coffee Roasts</h3> <br>
    <p>In order to prepare the beans for brewing, they must first be roasted. Differences in roast time significantly effect the flavor, aroma, and color
      of the coffee.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Light: </strong>Light roasts provide the lightest, most delicate flavors and can often be more acidic.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium: </strong>Medium-roasted beans will have a chocolate brown color, dry surface, and a full flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Dark: </strong>Dark-roasted beans have a flavor that is strong, smoky, and sometimes spicy. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Choosing The Roast</h3>
    <p>The way the coffee bean is roasted also affects the flavour, regardless of whether the bean is arabica or robusta. Beans are roasted for varying amounts
      of time, impacting the way the sugars and fats in the coffee bean degrade and therefore shaping the taste of the liquid in the cup.
    <br>
    <br>
      A shorter roast time produces a lighter roast, which tends to have a cleaner taste and is more acidic. As the beans absorb heat, they become darker and
      oils appear on the surface. Darker roasts are less acidic, with a stronger, heavier flavour.</p>
