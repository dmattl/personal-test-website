    <h1>Basics Of Brewing</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, <br>
      including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press.</p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>Make sure that your tools — from bean grinders and filters to coffee makers— are thoroughly cleaned after each use. <br>
    Rinse with clear, hot water and dry with an absorbent towel. It’s important to check that no grounds have been left <br>
    to collect and that there’s no build-up of coffee oil, which can make future cups of coffee taste bitter and rancid.</p>
    <h3>Water Ratio</h3>
    <p>How the coffee is brewed is just as important as the quality of the raw materials themselves. Too much water and the coffee is too weak; <br>
      too little and it is overly strong and unpalatable. Espresso usually has a ratio of 1:1 to 1:3 coffee to water, while cafetiere coffee has <br>
      a ratio nearer to 1:18.</p>
    <h3>Water Temperature</h3>
    <p>The hotter the water, the faster the elements that give coffee its aroma and taste are extracted. Boiling water should never be used – a temperature <br>
      just off the boil of 91-96°C is ideal. Any colder and the it will taste weak, any hotter and it will be bitter. Cold-brew coffee, made by steeping grounds <br>
      in cold water for up to 24 hours, is mellow, sweet and has a lower acidity.</p>
    <h3>Brewing Time</h3>
    <p>The amount of time that the water is in contact with the coffee grounds is another important flavor factor. In a drip system, the contact time should be <br>
      approximately 5 minutes. If you are making your coffee using a French Press, the contact time should be 2-4 minutes. Espresso has an especially brief brew <br>
      time - the coffee is in contact with the water for only 20-30 seconds. Cold brew, on the other hand, should steep overnight.</p>
