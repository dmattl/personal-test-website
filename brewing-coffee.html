    <h1>Basics Of Brewing</h1>
    <p class="top-p">Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this,
      including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press.</p>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>Make sure that your tools — from bean grinders and filters to coffee makers— are thoroughly cleaned after each use.
    Rinse with clear, hot water and dry with an absorbent towel. It’s important to check that no grounds have been left
    to collect and that there’s no build-up of coffee oil, which can make future cups of coffee taste bitter and rancid.</p>
    <h3>Water Ratio</h3>
    <p>How the coffee is brewed is just as important as the quality of the raw materials themselves. Too much water and the coffee is too weak;
      too little and it is overly strong and unpalatable. Espresso usually has a ratio of 1:1 to 1:3 coffee to water, while cafetiere coffee has
      a ratio nearer to 1:18.</p>
    <h3>Water Temperature</h3>
    <p>The hotter the water, the faster the elements that give coffee its aroma and taste are extracted. Boiling water should never be used – a temperature
      just off the boil of 91-96°C is ideal. Any colder and the it will taste weak, any hotter and it will be bitter. Cold-brew coffee, made by steeping grounds
      in cold water for up to 24 hours, is mellow, sweet and has a lower acidity.</p>
    <h3>Brewing Time</h3>
    <p>The amount of time that the water is in contact with the coffee grounds is another important flavor factor. In a drip system, the contact time should be
      approximately 5 minutes. If you are making your coffee using a French Press, the contact time should be 2-4 minutes. Espresso has an especially brief brew
      time - the coffee is in contact with the water for only 20-30 seconds. Cold brew, on the other hand, should steep overnight.</p>
